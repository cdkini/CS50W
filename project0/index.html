        <h1>Tenets of Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        <p>
            Object oriented programming, often abbreviated as OOP, is a programming paradigm that divides 
            logic between different objects, each of which has its own unique attributes and methods. Objects are created by
            classes, which act as object blueprints by providing initial attributes and implementations of behavior. In dividing
            a code base in this manner, the user is able to compartmentalize data into realistic and digestible components. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us take a look at an example. Let's say we wanted represent a book through the lens of OOP. Firstly, let's think
            of what types of attributes a book has; information, including title, author, and page count, can all be represented
            as attributes of a book class. Additionally, let's consider the types of actions a book can perform, which we will
            represent as methods (functions associated with a particular class). Actions including opening and closing the book
            or highlighting elements of a page can be represented within our class structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            For purposes of representing our Book class (which I shall capitalize from here on to adhere to OOP stylistic
            preferences), I will utilize Java. As a programming language that was designed with OOP in mind, Java is a great
            way to understand the principles of OOP, which we will delve into later. Even if you are not familiar with Java
            syntax or static typing, take a look at the following Java code for our Book class and try to piece together our
            implementation:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            public class Book {

                // Our member variables or attributes
                private String title;
                private String author;
                private int pageCount;
                private bool isOpen;

                // Our constructor
                public Book(String title, String author, int pageCount) {
                    this.title = title;
                    this.author = author;
                    this.pageCount = pageCount;
                    this.isOpen = false;
                }

                // Our class functions or methods
                public void openBook() {
                    ...
                }

                public void closeBook() {
                    ...
                }

                public void highlightWord(int pageNum, int pageRow, String word) {
                    ...
                }

            }
        </code></pre>
        <p>Let's walk through this code piece by piece and break down what is happening. Firstly, let's look at our
            member variables, often referred to as attributes. As we noted earlier, books have certain pieces of data
            associated with them that are important to represent programmatically if we wish to accurately model books
            in our code. While the first three are straightforward, can you think why we included <code>private bool
            isOpen</code> ?
        </p>
        <p>Moving on, let's take a look at our constructor, which is a method associated with the creation or instantiation
            of an object. It takes in key pieces of information relevant to the particular book we are trying to model and
            assigns them to the attributes we previously mentioned. Note that as the books we are modeling are always closed
            to begin with, there is no need to pass the book's open/closed status as a constructor argument. It is closed by
            default as so, we shall assign a <code>false</code> value to it for each instance of our Book class.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, let's take a look at our functions, which are called methods when associated with a class. As discussed
            previously, we want to model the types of actions a Book object can perform. The actual implementation details
            are not included but try to think how we would interact with the attributes we discussed earlier. If you didn't
            figure it out earlier, the use for <code>private bool isOpen</code> should be more apparent after seeing our
            methods. Note that like any regular function, methods can take in and output any type of data. As our methods
            do not return any particular value, we deem them <code>void</code> in accordance with Java's static typing
            requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Before diving into more complex OOP principles, make sure you understand how basic classes work. Additionally, 
            try to implement your own in your preferred language and take some time to do further research on anything you
            might not entirely understand. The next four ideas, which I've dubbed the <b>Tenets of OOP</b>, are a step up in complexity
            so you may need to conduct further research and experimentation before you get comfortable with everything in here.
            I've included a glossary of terms below for your review:

                <tr>

                    <td>Def</td>
